# Process Dynamics and Control

This repository contains a full course on process dynamics and control. All contents are obtained from the APMonitor website: https://apmonitor.com/pdc. All content from this course website was converted into Jupyter Notebooks for better structuring of the course. 

The course focuses on a complete start to finish process of physics-based modeling, data driven methods, and controller design. Although some knowledge of computer programming is required, students are led through several introductory topics that develop an understanding of numerical methods in process control.

The course focuses on methods that are used in practice for simple or complex systems. It is divided into three main parts including (1) data driven modeling and controller development, (2) physics-based modeling and controller development, and (3) advanced controls with optimization. Example problems are provided throughout in the Python programming language.
