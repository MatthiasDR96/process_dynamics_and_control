    "## First Order Plus Dead Time (FOPDT)\n",
    "A first-order linear system with time delay is a common empirical description of many stable dynamic processes. The First Order Plus Dead Time (FOPDT) model is used to obtain initial controller tuning constants. An interactive FOPDT IPython Widget demonstrates the effect of the three adjustable parameters in the FOPDT equation. Downloading and running the iPython notebook locally reveals three slider bars that update the plot based on changes to the gain \n",
