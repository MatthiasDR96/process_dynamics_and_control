    "Optimization deals with selecting the best option among a number of possible choices that are feasible or don't violate constraints. Python can be used to optimize parameters in a model to best fit data, increase profitability of a potential engineering design, or meet some other type of objective that can be described mathematically with variables and equations. Mathematical optimization problems may include equality constraints (e.g. =), inequality constraints (e.g. <, <=, >, >=), objective functions, algebraic equations, differential equations, continuous variables, discrete or integer variables, etc. A general statement of an optimization problem with nonlinear objectives or constraints is given by the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{minimize} \\quad J(x)$$\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{subject\\;to}\\quad g(x)>0$$\n",
    "$$\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad f(x)=0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Karush Kuhn Tucker conditions must be satisfied in order to verify that a potential solution is optimal. An optimization problem has an objective $J(x)$, $n$ inequality constraints $g(x)$, and $m$ equality constraints $f(x)$:\n",

    "$$\\mathrm{subject\\;to}\\quad g_i(x) \\ge 0 \\quad i=1,\\ldots,n$$\n",
    "$$\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad f_i(x) = 0 \\quad i=1,\\ldots,m$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four KKT conditions for optimal primal $(x)$ and dual $\\lambda$ variables. A dual variable is a shadow price that shows how much the objective function can be locally improved if that constraint did not exist. The asterisk (*) is an indication that it is an optimal value.\n",

    "\n",
